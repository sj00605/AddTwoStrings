This a an implementation of how to add together two integers and/or decimals represented by
strings without converting them to integers. This is a symbolic manipulation that allows for adding values greater than
MAXINT.

These are the requirements for the input strings

* All characters in the string must be a number
* The only non-numeric value allowed is a decimal point and there can only be one
* We can assume inputs have been sanitized
